# pyextensions

In October 2015, I wrote a
[first blog post](https://aroberge.blogspot.com/2015/10/from-experimental-import-somethingnew.html)
about a way to facilitate making
(small) changes to Python's syntax.  At the time, I wrote:

    _I'm not ready yet to bring another suggestion to the python-ideas list._

As I write this (in August 2018),
I am still not ready to bring it as a suggestion to
the python-ideas list. However, I want to be able to do so "soon".
This repository is intended to be a collaborative tool to write a document
which could form the basis of a future PEP on this topic.
