# Quote from the Python Cookbook

On page 420 of the _Python Cookbook_ (3rd edition) by David Beazley
and Brian K. Jones, it is written:

> _...it should be emphasized that Python's module, package and import
> mechanism is one of the most complicated parts fo the entire language --
> often poorly understood by even the most seasoned Python programmers
> unless they've devoted effort to peeling back the covers._
