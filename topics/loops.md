# Loops

Computers are very good at repeating instructions. To have them do so, we
use _loops_.  There are many kinds of loops. We can group them in 4 categories,
with various sub-categories introduced, in Python, by using either the
keyword `continue` or `break`. Excluding the sub-categories, and given a set
of instructions to repeat, the four basic loops categories are:

1. repeat the instructions a fixed number of times
2. repeat them **while** a condition is satisfied
3. repeat them **until** a condition is satisfied
4. repeat them forever

In what follows, I will refer to these categories simply as

1. repeat n
2. repeat while
3. repeat until
4. repeat forever

I note that, for experienced programmers, the last two categories are usually
considered to be a single one, where one uses boolean logic (`not` in Python)
to transform a **while** type into an **until** type. However, this is not
the case for all beginners which has lead some designers of block-based programming
environments to distinguish between these two categories.

## Examples from Scratch

Scratch control blocks includes only 3 of the four categories:

1. repeat n

3. repeat until

![](/images/scratch_repeat_until.png)

4. repeat forever

Note that the word _repeat_ is absent for the infinite (forever) loop.
This is not the case for all languages; for example, the French version
does include the translation of _repeat_ for all 3 types of loops
including the infinite one.

To a Python programmer, it may come as a surprise that the `repeat until` is
included but not `repeat while`. Given the work that went into designing Scratch,
there is likely a fair bit of research that
lead to choosing this variant as the easiest and most natural
one to understand by beginners.
This might be because Scratch supports
programs with user interactions, such as mouse or key events,

and that, most often, one might want to keep on repeating **until** a
certain event takes place.

## Examples from Blockly

Blockly also includes only 3 of the four loop categories, but they are
not the same as Scratch.

1. repeat n

2. repeat while

3. repeat until

![](/images/blockly_repeat_until.png)

`repeat while` and `repeat until` are variants of a single block

Blockly does not include a `repeat forever` block.

### From Blockly to Python

Blockly can translate block configurations into valid code for various
programming languages including Python.  Here, we show two examples
from [Reeborg's World](http://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html).

Note that the color scheme used for individual blocks is different in Reeborg's World
as compared with that used in Blockly.

As we can see, the required indentation of Python's syntax is a very
natural counterpart to Blockly's structure.

[Reeborg's World](http://reeborg.ca/reeborg.html) can also use the Javascript
version of the code generated by Blockly. While Javascript does not attach
any meaning to code indentation, Blockly nonetheless uses indentation to
help users connect the textual and the block representation of a given
code sample.

### Further loops from Blockly

In addition to a variable-less version of `repeat n`, Blockly makes it
possible to define a block that is very similar to the more complex
version of Python's `for var in range(...)`.

It also includes a loop with a finite number of repetitions set by
the number of elements in a container
